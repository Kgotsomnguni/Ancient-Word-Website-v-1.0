            </p>

            <h4> Quality Management Systems (ISO 9001:2015): </h4>
            <p>This standard provides a comprehensive
                approach to quality management, covering quality planning, risk management, and
                performance evaluation to ensure continual improvement of a Quality Management
                System (QMS).
            </p>

            <h4>Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (ISO 45001:2018):</h4>
            <p> This standard
                focuses on establishing, maintaining, and improving an Occupational Health and Safety
                Management System (OHSMS). It includes guidelines for hazard identification, risk
                assessment, and compliance with legal requirements.</p>

            <h4>Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines (ISO 45002:2022): </h4>
            <p>Offering practical
                implementation advice for ISO 45001, this standard emphasizes stakeholder

            </p>

            <h4>Risk Management (ISO 31000:2018):</h4>
            <p>Provides principles and a framework for managing
                risk, encompassing risk assessment techniques and strategies for risk treatment.
            </p>

            <h4>Occupational Health Management (ISO 45006:2021):</h4>
            <p>Focuses on integrating

                management strategies.</p>

            <h4>Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001:2015):</h4>
            <p>This standard offers a
                framework for establishing, maintaining, and improving an Environmental
                Management System (EMS), with a focus on setting environmental objectives,
                conducting audits, and ensuring compliance.</p>

            <h4>Environmental Management Implementation Guidelines (ISO 14004:2016):</h4>
            <p>Provides
                practical steps for implementing ISO 14001, including stakeholder engagement and
                documentation practices</p>

            <h4>Phased Implementation of EMS (ISO 14005:2020):</h4>
            <p>Details strategies for the gradual
                implementation of an EMS, setting incremental goals, and managing organizational
                change.</p>

            <h4>Ecodesign Principles (ISO 14006:2020):</h4>
            <p>Guides the incorporation of ecodesign principles
                into the EMS, aimed at enhancing product sustainability and reducing environmental
                impacts.</p>

            <h4>Greenhouse Gas Reporting (ISO 14064-1:2018):</h4>
            <p>Outlines methods for quantifying and
                reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals, including the creation of GHG

            <p>Participants will gain a thorough understanding of quality, environmental, and occupational
                health & safety management systems. They will learn to effectively implement ISO 9001 for
                quality management, ISO 14001 for environmental management, and ISO 45001 for
                occupational health and safety. The course also covers phased EMS implementation, ecodesign
                for improved product sustainability, and GHG reporting. This integrated approach will enhance
